# The Reliable Source

By Wednesday, the story had spread from Deokgo Hall through Dasan-gwan and up to the observation deck: Yejoon's father was being investigated. For what, no one agreed. Bribery. Fraud. Something worse—something people wouldn't say aloud, even in English.

Yejoon herself seemed to have evaporated.

She attended classes, submitted work, but her eyes had gone flat. During kumdo practice, her form was mechanical, perfect, empty of the small human tremors that made a body alive. The other girls noticed. They always noticed. Information was how the Academy worked—230 girls and 230 boys on a mountain 120 kilometers from Seoul, all of them top three percent, all of them fluent in surveillance.

"The reliable source was Minseok," someone whispered in the library.

"How do you know?"

"My roommate's cousin saw him tell Jina in English class."

The English-only rule meant the rumors were sharp, professional. They moved like sharpened blades.

On Friday, Yejoon found Minseok alone in the observation deck, where the air was thin and the school below looked like something that had been assembled wrong.

"Why?" she asked.

He couldn't answer. She was looking at him the way the guidance counselor looked at students who'd violated the honor code—with a kind of clinical disappointment that suggested she'd already calculated his entire future.

"You knew my father's trial happened four years ago," she said. "You knew it was supposed to be forgotten. You knew I was here specifically so no one would know."

"I didn't think—"

"You think perfectly well." She stepped closer. "You calculated that I was worth less than the practice. That the exercise of spreading information mattered more than what the information would do."

He realized then that she'd understood something he hadn't: information at the Academy wasn't currency. It was a test. Each rumor a small ritual of cruelty disguised as intelligence-gathering. Each telling a rehearsal for the kinds of power he'd eventually wield in the world outside.

"What are you going to do?" he asked.

Yejoon smiled—thin, sharp, terrible.

"The same thing you did. Nothing. I'm just going to use it better."

By the next week, a story had emerged about Minseok's family. His mother's cousin. A company. Something unclear, something that required belief in elegant corruption—the kind of corruption that everyone at the Academy understood they'd be complicit in eventually.

The irony was that no one knew if it was true.

Yejoon had simply whispered it once, to the right person, in the right tone.

Now it spread like a contagion through the dormitories, refining itself, becoming more intricate with each telling. Minseok attended classes. He submitted work. But something had changed in how people looked at him—the way they'd looked at Yejoon, before she'd learned the real language of the Academy.

The mountain outside the windows remained indifferent, a dark permanence above everything.

No one spoke about it. The English-only rule made it possible to pretend none of this was real, to treat the demolition of another student as merely a conversation in a second language. Somewhere, someone's phone rang. Somewhere, a mother listened while her child explained, very carefully, in perfect English, why the family name might become a problem.

By graduation, most of them would forget this. They'd forget Yejoon. They'd forget Minseok. They'd forget that the Academy had taught them something more important than mathematics or history: that in a system where everyone is watched and everyone is watching, the most useful skill is knowing exactly when to speak, and what to say.

The reliable source, as always, would remain anonymous.

And the machine would continue, feeding on its own, producing leaders out of children who'd learned to destroy with words before they could destroy with anything else.

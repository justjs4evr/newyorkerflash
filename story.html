            <div class="story-body">
                <p>The fog in Hoengseong does not merely obscure; it redirects.</p>

                <p>According to the school’s architectural plan, the dormitory is a twelve-story structure. But if you
                    check the Namu Wiki entry—edited obsessively by the 11th graders during their reprieve from
                    "Myeonhak" (self-study)—you will find a debate about the 10th Floor.</p>

                <p>They say Room 1001 is different. It is 1.5 times larger than the standard three-person cell. It is
                    the Founder’s Room. And it is usually empty.</p>

                <p>"Have you checked the angle?" Ji-min whispered.</p>

                <p>We were standing in front of Dasan Hall. It was 2:00 A.M., and the bronze statue of Jeong Yak-yong
                    (Dasan) loomed over us, wet with mist. The great scholar held a book, his expression stoic, but his
                    thumb—his right thumb—was extended in a gesture that looked less like a scholar's contemplation and
                    more like an accusation.</p>

                <p>"The urban legend says he's pointing at the library," I said, shivering in my saenghwalbok. "Or the
                    gym."</p>

                <p>"No," Ji-min said, pulling out a laser pointer. "Namu Wiki says he points to Deokgo Hall, Room 707."
                </p>

                <p>He clicked the laser. The red dot cut through the fog, tracing the line of the bronze thumb. It shot
                    across the courtyard, past the English Education Building, and hit the dark window of the annex
                    building, Deokgo Hall.</p>

                <p>Seventh floor. Seventh window.</p>

                <p>"That's where the Dutch soldier lives," Ji-min murmured.</p>

                <p>"The what?"</p>

                <p>"The One-Legged Dutch Soldier. Don't you read the 'Incidents' tab? They say a ghost from the Korean
                    War lives in Room 707. He doesn't speak English or Korean. He just... hops."</p>

                <p>I laughed. It was the absurdity of it—a Dutch ghost in a school dedicated to Minjok (national)
                    spirit. But the red dot on the window didn't waver.</p>

                <p>Then, the light in Room 707 turned on.</p>

                <p>It wasn't the fluorescent blue of a study lamp. It was yellow. Old, incandescent yellow.</p>

                <p>"Ji-min," I whispered. "Turn off the pointer."</p>

                <p>"I... I did."</p>

                <p>The laser was off. But the red dot was still there on the glass. It wasn't a laser anymore. It was an
                    eye. A single, glowing red eye staring back at us from Deokgo Hall.</p>

                <p>And then, the phone in Ji-min’s pocket buzzed.</p>

                <p>It wasn't a text. It was a notification from the school intranet, the "Minjok Network."</p>

                <div class="notification-box">
                    <p><strong>New Room Assignment:</strong></p>
                    <p>Student: Lee, Ji-min</p>
                    <p>Current Room: Dormitory 402</p>
                    <p>New Room: Deokgo Hall 707</p>
                </div>

                <p>Ji-min dropped the phone. "There are no student rooms in Deokgo," he stammered. "It's a faculty
                    building. It's..."</p>

                <p>From the seventh floor, the window slid open. We couldn't see a face. We only heard a sound. It
                    wasn't a scream. It was the rhythmic, heavy sound of something heavy hitting the floor.</p>

                <p><em>Thump. (Pause). Thump. (Pause).</em></p>

                <p>It was getting louder. It was coming down the stairs.</p>

                <p>We ran toward the dormitory, our saenghwalbok flapping like grey wings. We didn't look back at the
                    statue of Dasan. But I knew, with the terrifying certainty of a 4.0 student realizing they misread
                    the prompt, that the thumb wasn't pointing at a room.</p>

                <p>It was pointing at us.</p>
